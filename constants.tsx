2. Check regional Unifier status: Is their local cache responding?
3. Test alternate workstation: Is this user-specific or systemic?

**Secondary Investigation (5-15 minutes)**:
1. Query IRIS message logs for recent DICOM transfers
2. Check Azure App Services health dashboard
3. Verify PowerScribe API connectivity if report-related

**Escalation Criteria**:
* Multiple users affected across different workstations
* Complete regional Unifier failure
* Azure service degradation confirmed

### **"Reports Missing from EMR" Response Protocol**

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Search IRIS HL7 logs for ORU message generation
2. Verify PowerScribe report completion status
3. Check RIS/EMR HL7 listener connectivity

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **PowerScribe Issue**: Report stuck in draft, dictation not completed
2. **IRIS Transformation Issue**: HL7 message format rejection by EMR
3. **Network Issue**: HL7 port blocked, VPN tunnel down
4. **EMR Issue**: Interface engine down, database connectivity problems

    {
        id: 'hl7',
        title: 'HL7 Failures: Reports Missing from EMR/RIS',
        content: `
This issue directly relates to failures in the HL7 message flow. [cite_start]When a radiologist completes a report, it should be sent as an ORU (Observation Result) message to the hospital's EMR and to billing systems[cite: 1, 2, 34].

* **Symptom**: Reports not appearing in the RIS/EMR, billing discrepancies, or missing patient data.
* **Integration Points of Failure**:
    * [cite_start]**PowerScribe 360**: The report may be stuck in a pending or draft status and has not been finalized to generate an HL7 message[cite: 15, 19, 32].
    * **LucidHealth IRIS Engine**: This is the central hub for message processing. [cite_start]A failure here is a primary cause[cite: 12, 14, 22]. [cite_start]It is responsible for transforming and routing messages from PowerScribe to their destination[cite: 1, 2, 33, 34].
    * **Lucid Technologies / Zotec Billing**: These are the downstream recipients for business intelligence and billing information. [cite_start]Connectivity issues can prevent them from receiving final report data[cite: 20, 27, 29, 34].
    * **Site's EMR/RIS**: The receiving system at the hospital may have its own interface engine or HL7 listener that is failing.
* **Potential Root Causes**:
    * **Message Queue Backlog**: IRIS may have a backup of messages that are not being processed, or there could be a high number of failed retries.
    * [cite_start]**Endpoint Connectivity Failure**: The HL7 listeners on the receiving systems, such as the hospital's EMR or Zotec Billing, may be down or unreachable[cite: 27].
    * **Malformed HL7 Data**: The message itself might have incorrect formatting or be missing required fields, causing the receiving system to reject it.
    * **Network Path Failure**: A firewall rule or a down VPN tunnel could be blocking the connection between the IRIS engine and the destination.
    * **Report Status in PowerScribe**: The report was never finalized by the radiologist, so an ORU message was never generated.

    {
        id: 'dicom',
        title: 'DICOM Failures: Images Not Loading',
        content: `
This problem points to a failure in the DICOM data flow, which involves moving large imaging studies from a hospital's on-site PACS to the cloud-based RadAssist platform via a local Unifier appliance.

* **Symptom**: Images are slow to retrieve, do not load at all, or studies appear incomplete.
* **Integration Points of Failure**:
    * [cite_start]**Hospital PACS**: The source Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) may not be sending the images correctly[cite: 748, 805, 883].
    * [cite_start]**Unifier Appliance**: A physical or virtual machine on-site at the hospital or regional datacenter that caches images for faster retrieval[cite: 744, 763, 767, 772, 776]. [cite_start]It acts as a critical bridge between the local PACS and the cloud[cite: 744].
    * [cite_start]**Azure Public Cloud**: The core of the RadAssist platform, which includes App Services, Redis Cache, and storage that must be accessible for image viewing[cite: 824, 893].
    * [cite_start]**RadAssist Workstation**: The viewing station itself could have connectivity issues[cite: 819, 890].
* **Potential Root Causes**:
    * **Local Unifier Cache Issue**: The Unifier's 30-day cache may be over 90% full, requiring old studies to be purged.
    * **Network Connectivity**: HTTPS connectivity from the Unifier to Azure App Services could be blocked by a firewall, or there might be a DNS resolution problem.
    * **Cloud Platform Degradation**: A service outage within Azure or poor performance of the Redis Cache could impact image retrieval.
    * **Failed DICOM Transfer**: The DICOM C-STORE operation from the hospital's PACS to the Unifier may have failed.
    * **Unifier Services**: The services on the Unifier appliance itself may need to be restarted.
`
    },
    {
        id: 'powerscribe',
        title: 'PowerScribe Integration Failures',
        content: `
This issue disrupts the entire reporting workflow, as PowerScribe is the central dictation system where radiologists create their reports.

* **Symptom**: Dictations are not triggering correctly, reports are stuck in a "pending" status, or the normal reporting workflow is interrupted.
* **Integration Points of Failure**:
    * [cite_start]**LucidHealth IRIS and PowerScribe API**: IRIS communicates with PowerScribe via an API to automate the workflow[cite: 817, 818, 887, 888]. A failure in this connection is a critical failure point.
    * **Azure SQL Database**: The backend database stores the state of report transactions; issues here can leave reports in a pending state.
* **Potential Root Causes**:
    * **API Connectivity**: The HTTPS endpoints between the IRIS engine and the PowerScribe API are unreachable.
    * **Authentication Failure**: API access tokens may have expired, or security certificates may be invalid.
    * **Workflow State**: A query of the Azure SQL database could show that transactions for the affected reports are stuck.
    * **Clinical Impact**: The issue must be assessed for clinical urgency (e.g., a STAT report is a higher priority).
